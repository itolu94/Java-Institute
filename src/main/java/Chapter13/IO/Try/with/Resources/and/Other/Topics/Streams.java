//Java I/O is good for files and networks
    /*
     In java, I/O is performed through streams.
        Java defines two types of streams
            1. Byte Streams
                byte stream classes in java.io
                    a. BufferedInputStream - Buffered input stream.
                    b. BufferedOutputStream - Buffered output stream
                    c. ByteArrayInputStream - Input stream that reads from a byte array
                    d. ByteArrayOutputStream - Output stream that write to a byte
                    e. DataInputStream - An input stream that contains methods for reading the Java standard data types.
                    f. DataOutputStream - An output stream that contains methods for writing the Java standard data types
                    g. FileInputStream - Input stream that reads from a file
                    h. FileOutputStream - Output stream that writes to a file
                    i. FilterInputStream Implements InputStream.
                    j. InputStream - Abstract class that describes stream input
                    k. ObjectInputStream - Input stream for objects
                    l. ObjectOutputStream - Output stream for objects
                    m. OutputStream - Abstract class that describes stream output.
                    n. PipedInputStream - Input pipe.
                    o. PipedOutputStream - Output pipe.
                    p. PrintStream - Output stream that contains print() and println()
                    q. PushbackInputStream - Input stream that allows bytes to be returned to the input stream.
                    r. SequenceInputStream - Input stream that is a combination of two or more input streams that will be read sequentially , one after the other.
            2. Character streams
                character stream classes I/O classes in java.io
                    a. BufferedReader - Buffered input character stream
                    b. BufferedWriter - Buffered output character stream
                    c. CharArrayReader - Input stream that reads from a character array
                    d. CharArrayWriter - Output stream that writes toa  character array.
                    e. FileReader - Input stream that reads from a file.
                    f. FileWriter - Output stream that writes to a file.
                    g. FilterReader - Filtered reader.
                    h. FilterWriter - Filtered writer.
                    i. InputStreamReader - Input stream that translates bytes to characters
                    j. LineNumberReader - Input stream that counts lines
                    k. OutputStreamWriter - Output stream that translates characters to bytes
                    l. PipedReader - Input pipe
                    m. PipedWriter - Output pipe.
                    n. PrintWriter - Output stream that contains print() and println().
                    o. PushbackReader - Input stream that allows characters to be returned to the input stream
                    p. Reader - Abstract class that describes character stream input
                    q. StringReader - Input stream that writes to a string
                    r. Writer - Abstract class that describes character stream output
